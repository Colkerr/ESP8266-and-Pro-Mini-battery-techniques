Aiming to help anyone trying to run ESP*** from battery (and mention of Pro Mini also).
Not going to repeat what is well described elsewhere but it took me 2 years to find and get working these 'tricks' so hoping this speeds it up for others.
This will grow week by week as my code examples are all customised and embedded in large code systems now so I have to extract and test.
Will cover: ESP version, deepSleep, WiFi power use, OTA, AP, ESP_Now, variable persistence.
